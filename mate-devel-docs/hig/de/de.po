"Because MATE aims to be an international desktop, it needs to avoid imagery "

"offensive imagery is various body parts in a number of different "
"configurations. Aside from offensive gestures with the hands, arms or "
"fingers; body parts that are considered \"clean\" in one culture (such as "
"eyes), will be considered tasteless or gross to another (such as a nose). "
"Based on a survey of icons in MATE, body parts frequently appear in the "
"least communicative icons (often \"pointing\" at some element in the icon); "
"they are being used as an ineffective crutch for poor metaphor. In these "
"situations body parts should <emphasis>not</emphasis> be used. Even in "
"situations where the metaphor is appropriate (for example an eye representing "
"the sawfish appearance capplet) it is better to avoid using a body part. "
"Often body parts have been used in MATE to suggest a human \"choosing\" or "

"designer to make. People naturally attempt to understand objects in reference "
"to themselves (show someone a bat and they will think of hitting something "
"with the bat, show someone a tool and they will think of using it, etc). For "
"example, the font selector shows a finger pointing to an \"F\" suggesting the "
