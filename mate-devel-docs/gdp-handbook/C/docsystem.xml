  <title>MATE Documentation System</title>

  <para>
	The MATE Documentation System consists of DocBook, Yelp (MATE Help
	Browser), Scrollkeeper (document cataloging system), and the XML tools
	(called DocBook Tools) to transform and check the documentation.  Use of
	this system is necessary to write good documentation for MATE.  This
	chapter gives a brief overview describing the tools in the MATE
	Documentation System.
  </para>
  
  <!-- ####### The MATE Documentation System | DocBook ####### -->
  
  <sect2 id="docbooksys">
	<title>DocBook</title>
	
	<para>
	  DocBook is a markup language, like HTML, for technical and computer 
	  documentation, papers, and books.  The MATE Documentation Project 
	  uses DocBook to mark up MATE documentation.  The GDP currently uses 
	  version 4.1.2 of DocBook.  DocBook SGML is used 
	  with <application>gtk-doc</application> for developer documentation 
	  while DocBook XML is used for end user documentation.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The main advantage of DocBook is its single-source multiple-output
	  nature.  Only one DocBook source file is needed to make many different
	  outputs.  From the same DocBook file the GDP lets the user view the
	  documentation as HTML with <application>Yelp</application> and can
	  provide a print copy, usually in PDF.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The GDP uses the XSL language to exploit DocBook's multi source nature.  
	  XSLT stylesheets convert DocBook into HTML, which 
	  <application>Yelp</application> displays.  XSLT stylesheets are 
	  also used to convert DocBook into FO, an XML print specification, 
	  which is in turn converted to PDF or PS files.  If any other format 
	  is needed the GDP could use an XSLT stylesheet to convert the 
	  DocBook files into another format such as man or info pages.
	</para>
	<para>
	  DocBook focuses on the document content, leaving presentation details
	  to XSLT. For example all the applications within DocBook use the
	  <sgmltag>&lt;application&gt;</sgmltag> tag.  The stylesheets determine
	  how the text inside the tag looks.  Authors need not concern
	  themselves, for example, with whether all applications will be in bold
	  text or italics or whether the applications should not have any
	  special formatting, focusing instead on what ideas the documentation
	  should convey to the readers.

  <sect2 id="matehelpbrowser">
	<title>MATE Help Browser</title>
	
	<para>
	  At the core of the MATE help system is 
	  <application>Yelp</application>.  <application>Yelp</application> 
	  provides a unified interface to several
	  distinct documentation systems on Linux/Unix systems: man
	  pages, info pages, Linux Documentation Project (LDP)
	  documents, MATE application documentation, and other MATE
	  documents.
	</para>
	<para>
	  <application>Yelp</application> works by getting a list of all 
	  documentation installed on your system from 
	  <application>Scrollkeeper</application>, documentation cataloging 
	  system used by MATE, LDP, and other projects.  Thus, the documentation 
	  that appears in the <application>Yelp</application> is 
	  specific to each computer and will typically only represent
	  software that is installed on the computer.
	</para>
	<para>
	  MATE uses the documentation presented by all the various
	  MATE components and applications installed on the system to
	  present a complete and customized documentation environment.
	  <application>Yelp</application> describes only components which are 
	  currently installed on a users system.  Some of this documentation, 
	  such as the User's Guide, will be combined in such a way that it 
	  appears to be a single document.
	</para>
	<para>
	  By using such a system, you can be sure that any MATE application you
	  install that has documentation will show up in the index,
	  table of contents, and any search you do in the help browser.
	</para>
	<para>
	  <application>Yelp</application> also integrates the conversion from 
	  DocBook to HTML.  <application>Yelp</application> takes the DocBook 
	  document and runs a XSL processor, <application>xsltproc</application>, 
	  which uses a stylesheet to convert the DocBook file to a HTML 
	  file.  <application>Yelp</application> also uses the GDP's own 
	  stylesheets on top of Norman Walsh's stylesheets.  This allows 
	  the appearance of the all MATE documentation to change with only 
	  altering one specific stylesheet.  Using a custom stylesheet gives 
	  MATE a custom help environment.

      used in MATE 1.0.  It will read and display DocBook files

	<title>Using Subversion</title>
	<para>
		Subversion (SVN) is a tool that allows multiple developers to
		concurrently work on a set of documents, keeping track of the
		modifications made by each person.  The files are stored on a
		server and each developer checks files out, modifies them,
		and then checks in their modified version of the files. Many
		MATE programs and documents are stored in the Subversion
		repository. The MATE Subversion server allows users to
		anonymously check out files. Most GDP members will access the
		repository without a login to download the most up-to-date
		version of documentation or programs.  Modified documents
		will typically be emailed to the the application developer.
		Core GDP members may also be granted login privileges so they
		may commit modified files directly to the Subversion
		repositories. Below is a simple tutorial which will take you
		through the basics of using Subversion. A more complete guide
		is <ulink url="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/"><citetitle>

		Because files in Subversion are typically used and modified
		by multiple developers and documentation authors, users should
		exercise a few simple practices out of courtesy towards the
		other Subversion users and the project leader. First, you
		should not commit changes back to the Subversion repositories
		without first discussing your plans with the project leader.
		This way, the project leader knows who is modifying the files
		and generally, what sort of changes/development is being done.
		Also, whenever a Subversion user commits a file, they should
		make an entry in the Subversion log and in the <filename>
		ChangeLog</filename> so that other users know who is making
		modifications and what is being modified. When modifying files
		created by others, you should follow the indentation scheme
		used by the initial author.
