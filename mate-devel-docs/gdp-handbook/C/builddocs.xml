      <para>
        Documentation in MATE application repository and packages should be
        kept under <filename 
        class="directory">help/<replaceable>locale</replaceable>/</filename>, 
        where <filename><replaceable>locale</replaceable></filename>
        is typically replaced with <quote>C</quote> for the default (English)
        documents or the locale for other documents.  In some cases, 
        <quote>doc</quote> is used in place of <quote>help</quote> however
        it is preferrable to use <quote>help</quote> to remain consistent
        with the path under which these documents are installed.
      </para>
      <para>
        Most applications will have screenshots,
        images, or other figures.  To keep the directories reasonably
        clean and easy to navigate, screenshots, images, and other
        similar items should be placed in a directory called 
        <filename class="directory">figures</filename>.  While in some 
        cases the directory is called 
        <filename class="directory">images</filename>
        since most figures consist of images (well, screenshots 
        really), it is preferable to use <filename 
        class="directory">figures</filename> for consistency and to 
        allow for figures which contain things other than images.
      </para>
	  <para>
		Most packages have a COPYING file in the tree which explains the 
		rules or the license used to be able to copy any parts of the 
		package.  There should also be a COPYING-DOCS file which will 
		contain the FDL or other licenses the documenter and maintainer 
		agrees on.  An example file is found in Subversion in the module 
		<filename class="directory">mate-docu/gdp/</filename>
		<filename>COPYING-DOCS</filename> which contains the GNU Free 
		Documentation License.  The <filename>COPYING-DOCS</filename> file 
		should be placed in the same place the <filename>COPYING</filename> 
		file is located or in the top level of the package tree.  If you wish 
		to use the GFDL, you must have this file in the top level of the 
		package.

	  <title>Adding Documentation to the Build Setup</title>

    <para>A new build system has been developed for MATE 2.4. Each package will
      no longer be required to have its own copy of
      <filename>xmldocs.make</filename> and
      <filename>omf.make</filename>. Instead, the files are pulled from
      <application>mate-common</application> whenever the package is built from
      Subversion.</para>

    <para>To use the new system, in <filename>autogen.sh</filename> change the
      line that invokes <filename>mate-autogen.sh</filename> from:

      <programlisting>

USE_MATE2_MACROS=1 . mate-autogen.sh
      </programlisting>
to
      <programlisting>
USE_MATE2_MACROS=1 USE_COMMON_DOC_BUILD=yes . mate-autogen.sh
      </programlisting>
</para>
    <para>In addition, <filename>xmldocs.make</filename> and
      <filename>omf.make</filename> need to be removed from packages that used
      previous versions of the build system.</para>
    <note>
    <para>For programs that do not use <application>mate-common</application>,
      the files <filename>xmldocs.make</filename> and
      <filename>omf.make</filename> need to be manually installed. They can be
      found in <application>mate-common</application> Subversion in <filename
	class="directory">doc-build</filename>. They should be
	installed in the package's root directory.
	  </para>
    </note>
      <para>
	In the docs directory, a <filename>Makefile.am</filename> then is
	required that calls them:
	<programlisting>
figdir = figures
docname = mate-calculator
lang = C
omffile = mate-calculator-C.omf
entities = legal.xml
include $(top_srcdir)/xmldocs.make
dist-hook: app-dist-hook

    <title>Listing Documents in the Help Menu</title>

    <note>
      <title>Developer Information</title>
      <para>
        This section is for developers.  Documentation authors
        generally do not need to know this material.
      </para>
    </note>
    <para>
      Typically the application manual and possibly additional help
      documents will be made available to the user under the
      <guimenu>Help</guimenu> menu at the top right of the
      application.
    </para>
    
    <para>
	A macro is used in your menu definition to specify inclusion of the help
      item on the menu, as follows:
      
<programlisting>
static MateUIInfo help_menu[] = {
	MATEUIINFO_HELP("mate-calculator"),
	MATEUIINFO_MENU_ABOUT_ITEM(about_cb,NULL),
	MATEUIINFO_END
};
</programlisting>
      the line specifying <varname>MATEUIINFO_HELP</varname> causes
      MATE to create a menu entry which is tied to the documentation
	in the directory mentioned above. When the user selects <guimenu>Help</guimenu> from the menu, the default help browser, generally <application>Yelp</application>
      will display the documentation.
    </para>

	  <title>Adding Help Buttons</title>

	  <para>
	An example of adding a help button can be found in
	<filename>main.c</filename> of <application>gfloppy</application> in the
	<application>mate-utils</application> package. It bascically requires
	connecting <function>mate_help_display</function> to a button and
	testing for an error if the documentation is not found:
	<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
while ((button = gtk_dialog_run (GTK_DIALOG (toplevel))) >= 0) 
	GtkWidget *density_option;
	GtkWidget *dialog;

	if (button == GTK_RESPONSE_CLOSE)
