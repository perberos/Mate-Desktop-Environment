    <title>Introduction to DocBook</title>
    <para>
      To understand DocBook, a basic understanding of SGML and XML
      is helpful.
    </para>
    <para>
      SGML stands for Standard Generalized Markup Language and is
      one of the first markup languages ever created.  A
      different, but similar markup language is XML which stands
      for Extended Markup Langauge.  XML extends and structures
      SGML in ways which were optional using SGML.  Both use what
      are called Document Type Definitions (DTD) to define
      document structural types such as HTML and DocBook. A DTD
      specifies document <emphasis>elements</emphasis> which are
      delimited by angle brackets, &lt; and &gt;, and document text
      is then marked by both beginning and ending elements. Using
      the DocBook DTD, for example, one marks up a title with
      <sgmltag>&lt;title&gt;</sgmltag>The
      Title<sgmltag>&lt;/title&gt;</sgmltag>.  The DTD (in the case
      of the GDP, DocBook) also defines rules for how the elements
      can be used. For example, if one element can only be used
      when embedded within another, this is defined in the DTD.
    </para>
    <para> 
      A XML file is just a plain ASCII file containing the
      text with the markup specified above. To convert it to some
      easily readable format, you need special tools. The GDP uses
      <emphasis>xsltproc</emphasis>, a free converter which
      converts the DocBook file into browser readable HTML using
      XSL stylesheets.  <application>Yelp</application> is used to
      run <application>xsltproc</application> and then display the
      resulting HTML in a user friendly format.  You can read more
      about DocBook in <xref linkend="usingdocbook"/>.
    </para>
    <para>
      The final appearance of the output (e.g. PostScript or HTML) is
      determined by a <emphasis>stylesheet</emphasis>. Stylesheets are
      files, written in a special language (XSL &mdash; Extended
      Specification Language or DSSSL &mdash; Document Style Semantics
      and Specification Language), which specify the appearance of
      various DocBook elements, for example, what fonts to use for
      titles and various inline elements, page numbering style, and
      much more. You need to install a common collection of
      stylesheets in <xref linkend="installingdocbook"/> (Norman
      Walsh's modular stylesheets). The MATE Documentation Project
      uses a customized set of stylesheets on top of Norman Walsh's
      version.
    </para>
    <para>
      The advantage of specifying the <emphasis>structure</emphasis>
      of a document with XML instead of specifying the
      <emphasis>appearance</emphasis> of the document with a typical
      word processor, or with HTML, is that the resulting document can
      be processed in a variety of ways using the structural
      information.  Whereas formatting a document for appearance
      assumes a medium (typically written text on a standard-sized
      piece of paper), XML can be processed to produce output for a
      large variety of media such as text, postscript, HTML, Braille,
      audio, and potentially many other formats.  This assumption of a
      specific media makes translating documents not written in XML
      very difficult.
    </para>
    <para>
      Using elements contained in a document to structure the text
      of that same document also allows search engines to make use
      of that information. For example, if you are searching for
      all documents written by the author <quote>Susie</quote>
      your search engine could be made smart enough to only search
      &lt;author&gt; elements, making for a faster and more
      accurate search.
    </para>
    <para>
      Using a stylesheet to determine the overall appearance of
      the output, rather than the DTD or the XML document, allows
      everyone in the project to create documents with the same
      look just by using the same stylesheet. It also allows the
      look to be updated just by modifying that one stylesheet.
    </para>
    <para>
      As stated before, the GDP uses the DocBook DTD.  For a list
      of introductory and reference resources on DocBook, see
      <xref linkend="resources"/>.  The following sections also
      provide convenient instructions on which markup tags to use
      in various circumstances.  Be sure to read <xref
	linkend="guidelines"/> for GDP documentation-specific
      guidelines.

      <title>Differences Between XML and SGML</title>

      <para> 
        In the not so distant future MATE Documentation Project
        will migrate from SGML to XML, a subset of SGML. This
        transition should be relatively painless: (almost) all DocBook
        tags will remain the same. However, XML has stricter syntax
        rules than SGML; thus, some constructions which are valid in
        SGML will not be valid in XML. Therefore, to be ready for this
        transition, it is <emphasis>strongly advised</emphasis> that
        the documentation writers conform to XML syntax rules. Here
        are most important differences:
      </para>
	
      <variablelist>
	  <varlistentry>
	    <term> <emphasis>Minimization</emphasis></term> 
	    <listitem>
	    
	    <para>
	      It is possible with some implementations of SGML to use
	      minimizations to close elements in a document by using
	      &lt;/&gt;, for example:
	      <literal><sgmltag>&lt;title&gt;</sgmltag>The
		Title<sgmltag>&lt;/&gt;</sgmltag></literal>. This is not
              allowed in XML. You can use <command>sgmlnorm</command> command,
              included in DocBook Tools package, to expand minimized tags;
              if you are using <application>Emacs</application> with psgml
              mode, you can also use the menu command
          <menuchoice>
             <guimenu>Modify</guimenu>
             <guimenuitem>Normalize</guimenuitem>
          </menuchoice>.

	    </varlistentry>
	  <varlistentry>
	    <term> <emphasis>Self-closing tags</emphasis></term> 
	    <listitem>
          <para>
            Some SGML tags are not allowed to have closing
            tags.  For example, it is legal in SGML for
            <sgmltag>&lt;xref&gt;</sgmltag> not to have a closing tag:
            <literal><sgmltag>&lt;xref
            linkend=&quot;someid&quot;&gt;</sgmltag></literal>. In
            XML, it is illegal; instead, you should use
            <literal><sgmltag>&lt;xref
            linkend=&quot;someid&quot;/&gt;</sgmltag></literal> (note
            the slash!).  </para>
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

	<varlistentry>
	    <term> <emphasis>Case sensitive tags</emphasis></term> 
	    <listitem>
	    <para>
	      In XML, unlike SGML, tags are case-senstive
	      <sgmltag>&lt;title&gt;</sgmltag> and
	      <sgmltag>&lt;TITLE&gt;</sgmltag> are different tags!
	      Therefore, please always use lowercase tags (except for
	      things like <literal>DOCTYPE, CDATA</literal> and
	      <literal>ENTITY</literal>, which are not DocBook tags).

  <sect2 id="docbook-begin"> 
    <title>Starting a Document</title>

    <para>
      DocBook can be used to write many different documents.
      Glossaries, FAQs, indexes, books, and articles are some of the
      documents which can be written.  To start the type of document
      you will need to enclose the document in the appropriate tag.
      You will be able to tell the type of document from the first
      tag.  For books you will enclose the document in the
      <sgmltag>&lt;book&gt;</sgmltag> tag and for articles you will
      enclose the document in the <sgmltag>&lt;article&gt;</sgmltag>
      tag.
    </para>

    <para>
      DocBook documents contain meta data, data which describes the
      document, typically at the beginning of the document.  This meta
      data will include copyright notices, author information,
      revision history, and release information.  The meta data is
      enclosed within the info tags.  For books you will enclose the
      meta data with the <sgmltag>&lt;bookinfo&gt;</sgmltag> tag and
      for articles you will enclose the meta data in the
      <sgmltag>&lt;articleinfo&gt;</sgmltag> tag.
    </para>

    <para>
      Throughout this chapter a full article will be produced showing
      you how to write a full article in DocBook.  So far we have
      <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
<article>
  <articleinfo>
  This will contain some information about the document.
  </articleinfo>
  This is the body of the document.
</article>
]]>
      </programlisting>
      as our document.  As you continue to learn more about DocBook
      the article will grow.
    </para>
    
    <sect3 id="docbook-section">
      <title>Sections and Paragraphs</title>
      <para>
	DocBook has sections for structuring your document up to 5
	sections deep.  Also paragraphs must be enclosed with the
	<sgmltag>&lt;para&gt;</sgmltag> tag.
	The top-level element of a book body is 
	<sgmltag>&lt;chapter&gt;</sgmltag>; it may contain one or more
	<sgmltag>&lt;sect1&gt;</sgmltag>, each of them may contain
	<sgmltag>&lt;sect2&gt;</sgmltag> and so on up to
	<sgmltag>&lt;sect5&gt;</sgmltag>. The top-level element of an
	article body is always
	<sgmltag>&lt;sect1&gt;</sgmltag>. Regardless of which elements
	you use, give each structural element an unique id, see <xref
	  linkend="guidelines-sectids"/>.
      </para>
      <para> 
	Please try to avoid using deeply nested sections. For
	most situations, <sgmltag>&lt;sect1&gt;</sgmltag> and
	<sgmltag>&lt;sect2&gt;</sgmltag> should be sufficient. If
	not, you probably should split your
	<sgmltag>&lt;sect1&gt;</sgmltag> into several smaller ones.
	For splitting large sections into smaller ones, see the
	<!--<xref/>???-->MATE Documentation Style Guide.
      </para>
      <para>
	Each section needs to contain a title.  The title is a concise
	description of the content of a section.  The
	<sgmltag>&lt;title&gt;</sgmltag> tag encloses the title of
	each section.  The title is placed right after the section
	tags but before the body of the section.  For help on writing
	good titles, see the MATE Documentation Style Guide.
      </para>
      <para> 
	Use the tag <sgmltag>&lt;para&gt;</sgmltag> for
	paragraphs.  If there is only one paragraph in a section you
	still need to use the <sgmltag>para</sgmltag> tag.
	You need to close the tag at the end of the all paragraphs.
	If the paragraph is only one line you should place the
	<sgmltag>para</sgmltag> tags on the same line.  If the
	paragraph is multiple lines the <sgmltag>para</sgmltag> tags
	should be placed on separate lines as shown in the example below.
      </para>
      <para>
	The most basic section of DocBook is made up of three parts.
	The section tags define where each section of text begins and
	ends, the title tags give a concise description of each
	section and the paragraph tags surround the text.  So for our
	article document looks like:
	<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
<article>
  <articleinfo>
  This will contain some information about the document.
  </articleinfo>

  <sect1>
    <title>DocBook Example</title>

</article>
]]>
	</programlisting>
	This is a very basic document with only one section and no
	meta data.
      </para>
    </sect3>

    <sect3 id="docbook-info">
      <title>DocBook Meta Data</title>

      <para>
	The meta data of a document is put in 
	<sgmltag>&lt;articleinfo&gt;</sgmltag> or
	<sgmltag>&lt;bookinfo&gt;</sgmltag> tags.  The title of the
	entire document is put in the meta data.  It is enclosed in
	the <sgmltag>&lt;title&gt;</sgmltag> tag.  The copyright
	information is enclosed in the
	<sgmltag>&lt;copyright&gt;</sgmltag> tags.  The copyright
	years are put inside the <sgmltag>&lt;year&gt;</sgmltag> tag
	and the copyright holder is put inside the
	<sgmltag>lt;holder&gt;</sgmltag> tag.  For example:
	<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
<copyright>
  <year>2002</year>
  <holder>Eric Baudais</holder>
</copyright>
]]>
	</programlisting>
	is how the copyright information should look like inside articleinfo.
      </para>

      <para>
	The author information contains the author's name, their
	address, and any affiliation.  The authors of a document are
	enclosed in the <sgmltag>&lt;authorgroup&gt;</sgmltag> tag.
	The individual author's information is put inside the
	<sgmltag>&lt;author&gt;</sgmltag> tag.  If there is only one
	author of the document you do not need the authorgroup tag.
	The author's name is divided into their firstname and surname
	with the two tags <sgmltag>&lt;firstname&gt;</sgmltag> and
	<sgmltag>&lt;surname&gt;</sgmltag>.  The author's affiliation
	is put inside the <sgmltag>&lt;affiliation&gt;</sgmltag> tag.
	The address can be the author's email address or a physical
	address where they can be contacted through regular mail.
	For example:
	<programlisting>

	is how the author information should look inside the
	articleinfo.  There are more information you can include
	inside the author tag.  This is just the basics of how to
	construct the meta data.
      </para>

      <para>
	The last meta data for a document is any legal statements such
	as the license of the document or any disclaimers or any
	warranties and the release information.  The legal information
	about the document is enclosed in the
	<sgmltag>&lt;legalnotice&gt;</sgmltag> tag.  You can have a
	title for the legalnotice using the
	<sgmltag>&lt;title&gt;</sgmltag> tag.  The legalnotice should
	be treated as a section of the articleinfo.  All paragraphs
	should be enclosed with the <sgmltag>&lt;para&gt;</sgmltag>
	tag.  The release information is enclosed in the
	<sgmltag>&lt;releaseinfo&gt;</sgmltag> tag.  This is different
	from the legalnotice because the release information is
	entered without any paragraph tags.  For example:
	<programlisting>

      DocBook has many other tags to structure a document than
      sections and paragraph.  Notes, figures, lists, and tables can
      all be included into a document and are as much a part of the
      way a document is structured as sections and paragraphs.  An
      explanatory figure or table in the right place will enlighten
      the reader and enhance the appearance and readability of the
      document.  The MATE Documentation Style Guide talks more about
      when and where to use these effectively.  Some of these are easy
      to use with DocBook while others take a while to master.

      <title>Screenshot Tools</title>
      <para>
	There are many tools for taking screenshots in
	MATE/Linux. Perhaps the most convenient is the
	<application>Take a Screen Shot</application> tool located in 
	<menuchoice>
	  <guimenu>Actions</guimenu>
	  <guisubmenu>Take a Screen Shot</guisubmenu>
	</menuchoice>.  Just choose whether you want to save the screenshot 
	to a file or on the desktop and click <guibutton>Okay</guibutton>.  
	When you click the <guibutton>Okay</guibutton> button the tool will 
	take a screenshot in a second.  If you want a window in focus you 
	will need to focus the window in the second from when you click 
	the <guibutton>Okay</guibutton> button to when the tool takes a 
	screen shot.  For applets in a <interface>Panel</interface>,
	<application>GIMP</application> can be used to crop the
	screenshot to only include the relevant portion of the
	<interface>Panel</interface>. Note that
	<application>GIMP</application> can both be used for taking
	screenshots, cropping screenshots, and converting image
	formats.  If you need to convert an image to PNG from another 
	format make sure you use compression liberally.  A high compression 
	level will usually look fine in <application>Yelp</application>.

              <xref linkend="docbook-specsymb" />). Also, please note
              that the result looks much nicer because the terms being

              are set in a different font. In this case, it was
              achieved by using <link

              tag. In other cases, use appropriate tags such as <link

	      This list is completely analogous to

	      for example <sgmltag>&lt;orderedlist

	  <listitem><para> This list is used when each entry is
	      rather long, so it should be formatted as a block of text
	      with some subtitle, like a small subsection.  The
	      <sgmltag>&lt;variablelist&gt;</sgmltag> is more complicated
	      than itemizedlists, but for larger blocks of text, or when
	      you're explaining or defining something, it's best to use
	      them.  Their greatest advantage is that it's easier for a
	      computer to search.  The lines you are reading now were
	      produced by <sgmltag>&lt;variablelist&gt;</sgmltag>. The
	      source looked liked this:

      </para>
      <para>  To mark keystrokes such as shortcuts and other
	commands, use <sgmltag>&lt;keycap&gt;</sgmltag>. 
	This is used for marking up what is printed on the top 
	of the physical key on the keyboard. There are a couple of
	other tags for keys, too: <sgmltag>&lt;keysym&gt;</sgmltag>
	and <sgmltag>&lt;keycode&gt;</sgmltag>. However you are
	unlikely to need these for most documentation. For reference,
	<sgmltag>&lt;keysym&gt;</sgmltag> is for the <quote>symbolic
          name</quote> of a key. <sgmltag>&lt;keycode&gt;</sgmltag> is
	for the <quote>scan code</quote> of a key. These are not
	terms commonly required in <acronym>MATE</acronym> documentation,

      </para>
      <para>
	To mark up a combination of keystrokes, use the

 <keycap>Alt</keycap>
 <keycap>F1</keycap>
</keycombo>]]>
	</programlisting>

	Finally, if you want to show a shortcut for some menu
	command, here are the appropriate tags (rather long):
	<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
<menuchoice>
 <shortcut>
  <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>q</keycap></keycombo>
 </shortcut> 
 <guimenuitem> Quit</guimenuitem>

	which produces simply

	<emphasis>character entities</emphasis>, which ii the XML analogue of
	macros, or commands, of LaTeX. They generally have the form 
	<sgmltag>&amp;entityname;</sgmltag>. Note that the semicolon
	is required.

      <para>

	Note that the actual look of the resulting symbols depends
	on the fonts used by your browser; for example, it might
	happen that long dash (<sgmltag>&amp;mdash;</sgmltag>) looks
	exactly like the usual dash (-). However, in the PostScript
	(and thus, in print) the output will look markedly better if
	you use appropriate tags.
