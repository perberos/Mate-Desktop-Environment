	This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
	program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
	other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
	this Lesser General Public License (also called <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">this License</span>”</span>).
	Each licensee is addressed as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">you</span>”</span>.
      </p>
<p>
	A <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">library</span>”</span> means a collection of software functions and/or data
	prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
	(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
      </p>
<p>
	The <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Library</span>”</span>, below, refers to any such software library or work
	which has been distributed under these terms.  A <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">work based on the
	Library</span>”</span> means either the Library or any derivative work under
	copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
	portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
	straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
	included without limitation in the term <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">modification</span>”</span>.)
      </p>
<p>
	<span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Source code</span>”</span> for a work means the preferred form of the work for
	making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
	all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
	interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
	and installation of the library.
      </p>
<p>
	Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
	covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
	running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
	such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
	on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
	writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
	and what the program that uses the Library does.
      </p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="sect1"></a>Section 1</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
	You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
	complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
	you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
	appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
	all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
	warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
	Library.
      </p>
<p>
	You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
	and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
	fee.
      </p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="sect2"></a>Section 2</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
	You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
	of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
	distribute such modifications or work under the terms of 
	<a class="link" href="terms.html#sect2" title="Section 2">Section 1</a> above, provided that 
	you also meet all of these conditions:

	</p>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="a">
<li class="listitem"><p>
	       The modified work must itself be a software library.
	    </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
	      You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
	      stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
	    </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
	      You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
	      charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
	    </p></li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>
	      If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
	      table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
	      the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
	      is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
	      in the event an application does not supply such function or
	      table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
	      its purpose remains meaningful.
	    </p>
<p>
	      (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
	      a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
	      application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
	      application-supplied function or table used by this function must
	      be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
	      root function must still compute square roots.)
	    </p>
<p>
	      These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
	      identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
	      and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
	      themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
	      sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
	      distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
	      on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
	      this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
	      entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
	      it.
	    </p>
<p>
	      Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
	      your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
	      exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
	      collective works based on the Library.
	    </p>
<p>
	      In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
	      with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
	      a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
	      the scope of this License.
	    </p>

<div class="sect2">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="sect3"></a>Section 3</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
	You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
	License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
	this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
	that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
	instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
	ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
	that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
	these notices.
      </p>
<p>
	Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
	that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
	subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
      </p>
<p>
	This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
	the Library into a program that is not a library.
      </p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="sect4"></a>Section 4</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
	You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
	derivative of it, under <a class="link" href="terms.html#sect2" title="Section 2">Section 2</a>
	) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 
	<a class="link" href="terms.html#sect1" title="Section 1">1</a> and 
	<a class="link" href="terms.html#sect2" title="Section 2">2</a> above provided that you accompany
	it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
	must be distributed under the terms of Sections <a class="link" href="terms.html#sect1" title="Section 1">1</a>
	and <a class="link" href="terms.html#sect2" title="Section 2">2</a> above on a
	medium customarily used for software interchange.
      </p>
<p>
	If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
	from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
	source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
	distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
	compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
      </p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="sect5"></a>Section 5</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
	A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
	Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
	linked with it, is called a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">work that uses the Library</span>”</span>.  
	Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
	therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
      </p>
<p>
	However, linking a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">work that uses the Library</span>”</span> with the Library
	creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
	contains portions of the Library), rather than a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">work that uses the
	library</span>”</span>.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
	<a class="link" href="terms.html#sect6" title="Section 6">Section 6</a> states terms for distribution 
	of such executables.
      </p>
<p>
	When a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">work that uses the Library</span>”</span> uses material from a 
	header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work 
	may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
	Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
	linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
	threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.	
      </p>
<p>
	If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
	structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
	functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
	file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
	work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
	Library will still fall under <a class="link" href="terms.html#sect6" title="Section 6">Section 6</a>.)
      </p>
<p>
	Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
	distribute the object code for the work under the terms of 
	<a class="link" href="terms.html#sect6" title="Section 6">Section 6</a>.
	Any executables containing that work also fall under 
	<a class="link" href="terms.html#sect6" title="Section 6">Section 6</a>,
	whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
      </p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="sect6"></a>Section 6</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
	As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
	link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
	work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
	under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
	modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
	engineering for debugging such modifications.
      </p>
<p>
	You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
	Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
	this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
	during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
	copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
	directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
	of these things:

	</p>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="a">
<li class="listitem"><p><a name="sect6a"></a>
	      Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
	      machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
	      changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
	      Sections <a class="link" href="terms.html#sect1" title="Section 1">1</a> and 
	      <a class="link" href="terms.html#sect2" title="Section 2">2</a> above); and, if the work is an 
	      executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable 
	      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">work that uses the Library</span>”</span>, as object code and/or source 
	      code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to 
	      produce a modified executable containing the modified Library.  (It is 
	      understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files 
	      in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
	      to use the modified definitions.)
	    </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
	      Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
	      Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
	      copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
	      rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
	      will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
	      the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
	      interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
	    </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
	      Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
	      least three years, to give the same user the materials
	      specified in <a class="link" href="terms.html#sect6a">Subsection 6a</a>
	      , above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing 
	      this distribution.	      
	    </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
	      If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
	      from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
	      specified materials from the same place.
	    </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
	      Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
	      materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
	    </p></li>
</ol></div>
<p>
      </p>
<p>
	  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
	  Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
	  reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
	  the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
	  normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
	  components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
	  which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
	  the executable.
	</p>
<p>
	  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
	  restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
	  accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
	  use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
	  distribute.

<p>
	You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
	Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
	facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
	library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
	the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
	permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
      </p>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="a">
<li class="listitem"><p>
	    Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
	    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
	    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
	    Sections above.
	  </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
	    Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
	    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining

<a name="sect8"></a>Section 8</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
	You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
	the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
	attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
	distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
	rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
	or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
	terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="sect9"></a>Section 9</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
	You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
	signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
	distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
	prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
	modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
	Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
	all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
	the Library or works based on it.

<div class="sect2">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="sect10"></a>Section 10</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
	Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
	Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
	original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
	subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
	restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
	You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
	this License.

<div class="sect2">

<a name="sect11"></a>Section 11</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
	If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
	infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
	conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
	otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
	excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
	distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
	License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
	may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
	license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
	all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
	the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
	refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
      </p>
<p>
	If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
	particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
	and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
      </p>
<p>
	It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
	patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
	such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
	integrity of the free software distribution system which is
	implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
	generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
	through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
	system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
	to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
	impose that choice.
      </p>
<p>
	This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
	be a consequence of the rest of this License.

<p>
	If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
	certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
	original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
	an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
	so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
	excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
	written in the body of this License.

	The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
	versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
	Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
	but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
      </p>
<p>
	Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
	specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
	<span class="quote">“<span class="quote">any later version</span>”</span>, you have the option of following the terms and
	conditions either of that version or of any later version published by

	If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free

	write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
	copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
	Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
