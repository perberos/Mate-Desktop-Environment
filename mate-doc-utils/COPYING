The Mate Documentation Utilities is a collection of programs and data files
to help you build, maintain, and distribute documentation.  This package is
entirely free software; however, not all components of the package are under
the same free software license.

The GNU General Public License and the GNU Lesser General Public License are
used for particular components of this package, depending on need.  You should
have received a copy of both licenses with this package; see COPYING.GPL and
COPYING.LGPL.  If you did not receive these files, write to the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA.

This document attempts to provide a brief overview of the programs in this
package and their licensing terms.


xml2po
------
The xml2po program is used to convert between PO files and XML documents.
Within mate-doc-utils, it is used primarily to translate documentation
written in the DocBook format.  It was written by Danilo Segan.

xml2po is released under the terms of the GNU GPL.  PO and XML files
output by xml2po are unaffected by the GPL; you are free to license
them however you see fit.


mate-doc-prepare
-----------------
The mate-doc-prepare script is used to initialize your source tree for
using the mate-doc-utils build utilities.  It can also be used to create
a template document and the necessary supporting files and folders.  It
was written by Danilo Segan.

mate-doc-prepare is released under the terms of the GNU GPL.  The build
files output by mate-doc-prepare are unaffected by the GPL; you are free
to distribute them however you see fit.  The template files are separate
entities from mate-doc-prepare.  They should specify their own terms of
distribution.  In many cases, they will be simply stubs, and will have no
restrictions on modification or redistribution.

As a special exception to the GNU General Public License, if you distribute
mate-doc-prepare as part of a program that contains a configuration script
generated by Autoconf, you may include mate-doc-prepare under the same
distribution terms that you use for the rest of that program.


mate-doc-utils.make
--------------------
The mate-doc-utils.make make script can be included into your Makefiles
to build, verify, and install your documentation.  It was written by
Shaun McCance.

mate-doc-utils.make is released under the terms of the GNU GPL.  Most
files output by mate-doc-utils.make are actually output using one of
the other tools in this package, or using a commonly-available tool
from another package.  Thus, the files output by this script are not
affected by the GPL.  They may, however, be affected by the terms of
the individual programs that are being invoked.

We make every effort to avoid calling programs that will introduce
restrictions on redistribution of your package; however, we can not
guarantee that no such restrictions exist for files generated by tools
outside this package.

As a special exception to the GNU General Public License, if you distribute
mate-doc-utils.make as part of a program that contains a configuration script
generated by Autoconf, you may include mate-doc-utils.make under the same
distribution terms that you use for the rest of that program.


XSLT
----
This package contains various XSLT files for transforming DocBook and other
formats.  They were written primarily by Shaun McCance.

The XSLT files are released under the terms of the GNU LGPL.  You may build
customizations from these stylesheets using their public documented interfaces,
using either xsl:import or xsl:include, with no restrictions on your customized
stylesheets.  You may also invoke the stylesheets freely, either with a simple
XSLT processor such as xsltproc, or using an XSLT processing library within
your program.  The use of these stylesheets has no bearing on the licensing
terms of the XSLT processing program you use.

The files output by the stylesheets are not affected by the terms of the LGPL.
In particular, some of the stylesheets output program files rather than simple
data files.  The generated program files are also not affected by the LGPL.
You can redistribute all generated files as you see fit.

Sometimes it is necessary to include small portions of the stylesheets within
your source distribution to make building simpler for end users and packagers.
As a special exception to the GNU General Public License, if you distribute
the stylesheets as part of a program that contains a configuration script
generated by Autoconf, you may include those stylesheets under the same
distribution terms that you use for the rest of that program.


Images
------
This package contains a number of images that are used in the formatted
output.  They were created primarily by Josef Vybíral.  These images are
licensed under the terms of the GNU GPL.

As a special exception to the GNU General Public License, if you distribute
copies of your document formatted by the tools in this package, you may
redistribute unmodified copies of any images used or referenced in that
formatted copy without restriction.
