xml2po 1.0.7 — March 18th, 2004
...............................

This release is to get bug fixes out the door before getting on
with changing some of the structure to support image handling.

Fixes:
 o Build system (build outside srcdir, pkgconfig stuff)
 o Support multi-line comments as translators' comments
 o Improvements to DocBook handling

xml2po 1.0.6 — March 14th, 2004
...............................

Improvements:
 o Add support for space-preserving tags
 o Add support for more powerful document mode definitions, along
   with DocBook article definition which merges translator credits and 
   a language into output XML file
 o Add support for better handling of Mate Summaries using "-m gs"
 o Use autotools for installation

Changes:
 o Drop options -i, -f. They're now replaced with option "-m", and 
   previous meaning of "-m" (merge) is removed after it was deprecated
   for several releases.

Fixed:
 o Escaping of ", newline, tab and \ characters in PO files
 o Replacement of & in translations
 o Support namespaces in attribute names

xml2po 1.0.5 — March 12th, 2004
...............................

Fixed:
 o Entity handling — external entities are now handled differently (i.e.
   they're not substituted in the messages), and other entities can now 
   contain other tags

xml2po 1.0.4 — March 7th, 2004
..............................

Improvements:
 o New option "-a" to automatically try to select which tags are final
   and which are not, works better for random XML documents
 o new option "-p POFILE" which first produces a MO file for a user using
   system-installed msgfmt, and then performs the merge step
 o new option "-u LANG" which updates translation based on XML file
   (currently uses msgmerge and calls xml2po.py again)

Fixed:
 o There were some errors in worthOutputting where it considered only
   nodes which contained only text to be "worth", and others not

xml2po 1.0.3 — March 7th, 2004
..............................

Fixed:
 o a bug when element without content was omitted (eg. <br/>).

xml2po 1.0.2 — March 3rd, 2004
..............................

Improvements:
 o normalizeString enhanced (no stripping whitespace where it
   shouldn't be stripped)
 o support for translators' comments in XML files (first comment
   prior to tag is used)

 o implemented "-o FILE" option for directing output to FILE

xml2po 1.0.1 — March 1st, 2004
..............................

Second public release.  Allows translating XML documents,
with nested tags, resolving entity references, etc.

Tries to "just work", but it cannot do it completely.
