<title>Mobility Impairments</title>
<para>
Mobility impairments can be caused by arthritis, stroke, cerebral palsy, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and loss of limbs or digits, among others. Poor muscle control or weakness can make using standard keyboards and mouse devices difficult. For instance, some people are unable to type two keys simultaneously, while others tend to hit multiple keys or to bounce keys when pressing or releasing them. People who are able to use only one hand likewise have difficulties with some keyboard and mouse tasks. 
</para>
<para>
The technologies which can assist those with mobility impairments are:

If you have difficulty double-clicking, you can increase the period of time that the system allows to elapse between the first click and the second click of a double-click. For example, if the double-click timeout
setting is 0.4 seconds, you must perform the second click of a double-click within 0.4 seconds of the first click. If the second click occurs more than 0.4 seconds after the first click, the system interprets the two clicks as two single clicks.

Double-click on the light bulb to the right of the slider to test the setting. If you perform the two clicks of the double-click within the timeout specified, the light bulb lights up fully to display a yellow glow around the bulb. If you do not double-click 
within the timeout specified, the light bulb does not light fully. You should increase the timeout setting and try again. When the light bulb lights, the timeout setting is suitable for your needs.

<title>Dwell Click</title>
<para>
A click can be issued by having the mouse pointer dwell in a given spot for a specified delay. In this mode, the click-type is determined by the <guilabel>ClickType</guilabel> window, <application>Dwell Click</application> applet, or by the direction in which the user moves the mouse after the dwell time has elapsed. The click-type can be single, double, drag or right.

<para>
The <application>Pointer Capture</application> panel applet creates such an area on the panel, into which the user can lock the pointer until released in a determined way.

Preferences may be set by choosing <guilabel>Preferences</guilabel> in the context menu of the <application>Pointer Capture</application> applet:
</para>
<para>
In the <guilabel>Capture Pointer</guilabel> section, the user can specify under what circumstances the pointer gets captured when it moves into the capture area. For example, if the <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> modifier key is checked, the pointer gets captured when it is over the capture area and the user presses the <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> modifier key. If no modifier is checked and the mouse button is set to 0, the pointer only has to move into the capture area to get locked. It is also possible to specify a combination of modifiers and mouse button.
</para>

In the <guilabel>Release Pointer</guilabel> section, the user can specify what modifier or mouse button releases the pointer. It is also possible to specify a combination of modifiers and mouse button.

A toggle key is any key on the keyboard that
can switch between two states. The <keycap>Num Lock</keycap>, <keycap>Caps Lock</keycap>, and <keycap>Scroll Lock</keycap> keys are toggle keys. Most toggle keys have an associated light emitting diode (LED) on the keyboard that lights when the toggle key
