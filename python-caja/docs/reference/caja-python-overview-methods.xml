    <title>Explanation of Passive/Active Methods</title>

    <para>Because caja-python is an interface to a Caja' extension interface rather than a true library, it is
    rather quirky in how it works.  One example of this is that several providers have additional public methods
    that an extension actively calls, rather than the extension defining and the method in their class that is called by
    Caja.  You can see this with the <link linkend="method-caja-python-menu-provider--emit-items-updated-signal">caja.MenuProvider.emit_items_updated_signal</link>
    and <link linkend="method-caja-python-info-provider--update-complete-invoke">caja.InfoProvider.update_complete_invoke</link> methods, which
    the extension actively calls, passing the provider instance as a parameter.
    </para>
    
    <para>Due to this confusion, I have termed these actively-called methods <emphasis>Active Methods</emphasis> and the methods
    called by Caja are termed <emphasis>Passive Methods</emphasis>.</para>
