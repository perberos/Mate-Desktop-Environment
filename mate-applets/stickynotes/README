*** Sticky Notes for the Mate Desktop Environment. ***

This Mate 2.2 panel applet allows you to create, view, and maintain sticky
notes on your Mate Desktop. Each note is "sticky" (appears on all workspaces),
has a date stamp, and can be freely moved around your desktop. The notes are
automatically saved and will reappear in their original locations (with their
original dimensions) when the Mate Desktop is restarted.

Right-click on a sticky note's title or on the StickyNotes applet for
self-explanatory options.
