			      MATE Power Manager
			   A Power Manager for MATE

MATE Power Manager is a MATE session daemon that acts as a policy agent on top of
UPower, which requires fairly new versions of the kernel and udev.
MATE Power Manager listens for system events and responds with user-configurable actions.

MATE Power Manager comes in three main parts:

	- mate-power-manager:	    the manager daemon itself
	- mate-power-preferences:  the control panel program, for configuration
	- mate-power-statistics:   the statistics graphing program

To build, MATE Power Manager requires

	- Glib (2.13.0 or later)
	- Gtk2+ (2.11.0 or later)
	- MATE Keyring (0.6.0 or later)
	- DBus (0.70 or later)

	- Canberra (0.10 or later)
