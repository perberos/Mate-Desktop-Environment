      <para>
        You will only get a repeat notification if your battery percentage charge
        drops below 95% and then is again fully charged.
        This prevents some machines from showing unwanted repeat notifications
        if the battery is incorrectly reporting the charged status.

    <para>
      This has been removed from the information window of previous versions of

      UPS devices) but these are treated the same way as other devices.

  <section id="statistics-charge">
    <title>Charge History</title>
    <para>
      This graph shows the percentage charge available for the composite primary
      battery, so if you have a main laptop battery and an auxiliary battery
      then only the averaged value will be shown.
      A legend is not shown with this graph.

  <section id="statistics-power">
    <title>Power History</title>
    <para>
      This graph shows the power history charge used by the composite
      primary battery.
      This line represents the amount of power that is either being used to
      charge the batteries in the system, or the power being used by the system
      from the batteries.
      You should see the line go up when processor intensive tasks are
      performed, and down when the system is at idle, or when the screen is
      dimmed.
      A legend is shown with this graph when data events have been received.
    </para>

    <note>
      <para>
        You do will not receive rate data from your computer if it is not
        charging or discharging, or if the computer is suspended.
        This is due to hardware limitations where the rate is only sent from
        the battery management chip, rather than the power management chip on
        the motherboard.

  <section id="statistics-time">
    <title>Estimated Time History</title>
    <para>
      This graph shows the estimated charge history for the composite primary
      battery.
      This line represents the amount of time required until charged, or the
      amount of time until discharge.
      This line should go proportionally up when the rate decreases and down
      when the rate increases.
      A legend is shown with this graph when data events have been received.

    <title>Session and system idle times</title>
    <para>
      <command>mate-screensaver</command> is a session daemon that monitors user
      input, and if the mouse has not been moved, or the keyboard been pressed then
      it starts a timeout.
      When the value of this timeout reaches the value set in
      <command>mate-screensaver-preferences</command>, then the login is marked
      as 'session idle'.
      This is when &application; performs all the session idle actions such as
      enabling low-power mode and lowering the laptop panel brightness.

    </figure>
    <para>
      As soon as the session is marked at idle, &application; starts its own
      'system' timer.
      When the timeout set in <command>mate-power-preferences</command> is reached,
      and the CPU load is idle, then the idle action is
      performed, which is usually to turn off the screen, or to suspend or hibernate.
    </para>
    <para>
      To make this clearer, the sliders in <command>mate-power-preferences</command>
      are set to start at the value of the session-timeout + 1 minute, as we cannot
      logically trigger before the session is marked as idle.
      If you adjust the value of the 'session idle' timeout in
      <command>mate-screensaver-preferences</command> then the start of the sliders
      in <command>mate-power-preferences</command> will change accordingly.

      By default, &application; supports a simple locking scheme.

      hibernate action.
    </para>
    <para>
      There is a complex locking scheme available for power users that allows
      locking policy to change for the lid, suspend and hibernate actions.

  <section id="faq-suspend-hibernate-differences">
    <title>What's the difference between suspend and hibernate?</title>
    <para>
      The Suspend state is a power saving feature which is the lowest level of
      power consumption that preserves program data in the computer's memory.
      When your computer is in the Suspended state, computation will not be
      performed until normal activity is resumed.
      It will not resume until signaled by an external event such as a keyboard
      button press.
      It generally takes a few seconds to suspend and then resume your computer.
    </para>
    <caution>
      <para>
        You still use a small amount of battery power while suspended, so is
        not recommended for the low power action.
        If you remove AC power on a desktop, or run out of battery power on a
        laptop then you will lose your work.
      </para>
    </caution>
    <para>
      The Hibernation state saves the complete state of the computer to hard
      disk and turns off the power, so that the computer appears to be off.
      It will not resume until signaled by an external event such as a
      keyboard button press.
      This is the lowest power sleeping state available.
      If you remove AC power on a desktop, or run out of battery power on a
      laptop then work will not be lost.
      It can take up to a minute or more to hibernate and wake your computer.

  <section id="faq-dpms-broken-monitor">
    <title>
      My monitor is broken and treats DPMS standby and off states as
      'no-signal' which leaves the monitor powered on.
    </title>
    <para>
      You have to change the DPMS suspend mode &application; uses.
      Open <command>mateconf-editor</command>, and then change the keys 
      <literal>/apps/mate-power-manager/backlight/dpms_method_ac</literal> and
      <literal>/apps/mate-power-manager/backlight/dpms_method_battery</literal>
      to one of the modes that work, e.g. standby, suspend or off.

  <section id="faq-discharge-time-wrong">
    <title>
      My time to discharge is always incorrect due to a faulty battery, what
      can I do?
    </title>
    <para>
      You might be able to use the percentage charge for g-p-m to use as the
      policy data.
      Open <command>mateconf-editor</command>, and then change the key 
      <command>/apps/mate-power-manager/general/use_time_for_policy</command> to false.
      You can do this easily by doing:
      <command>
        mateconftool-2 --set --type bool
        /apps/mate-power-manager/general/use_time_for_policy false
      </command>
    </para>
    <para>
      This should get the policy actions working for you, but of course the
      time remaining will still be incorrect.

    <title>
      How do I make my application stop the computer auto-suspending?
    </title>
    <para>
      If your application is doing a long operation, you might want to
      disable the ability to suspend for a little while.
      You should use mate-session if you really don't want the user to be
      able to suspend, or for the computer to save power by hibernating
      or suspending.

  <section id="faq-acpi-delay">
    <title>
      I'm running ACPI. Why do events (such as removing the AC adapter)
      take so long to register?
    </title>
    <para>
      One of two things might be the problem.
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          HAL might not be running the addon that captures the ACPI event.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          You BIOS could be faulty, and might need a work-around.
          Please send a bug report.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
      For the first case, try to find the HAL processes that are running:
      <command>ps -eaf | grep hal</command>
    </para>
    <para>
      And check for the process <command>hald-addon-acpi</command>.
      If it is not being run, then please make sure that HAL is being run
      with the  <command>--retain-privileges</command> option in the
       <command>haldaemon</command> initscript.
      An alternative to this is to use acpid, rather than the kernel proc file.
